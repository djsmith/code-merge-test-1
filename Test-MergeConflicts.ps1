#
# Script to test alternative branching to resolve merge conflicts between main, develop,
# feature and release branches.
#
# The normal workflow for working with 'feature' branches is to start a Pull Request in
# Github to merge the given feature branch into the 'develop' branch. This allows other
# developers to review the code before it is deployed to the Dev environment for QA
# and client review.
# Unfortunately when there are merge conflicts between the 'develop' branch (from
# changes made via other feature branches) and the new feature branch, Github expects
# to merge the 'develop' branch into the 'feature' branch when resolving the conflicts.
# This results in changes to the 'feature' branch that are not relevant to that feature
# and will cause unrelated code changes to be merged into a 'release' branch that
# shouldnâ€™t be there.
# We need an alternative way to resolve merge conflicts, but still have the ability
# to review code changes via a Pull Request and have those changes deployed to the
# Dev environment.
